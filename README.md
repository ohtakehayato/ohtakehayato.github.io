## Getting Started
The easiest and recommended approach is to use the Github-hosted version of this project. The second method is to clone/download this project and host it in your own S3 bucket or even locally.

### Using the Github-hosted UI
Because the project is a collection of static HTML and JavaScript, you can use the application without deploying the code into your own AWS account.

 To get started, go to the hosted [Kinesis Video Streams Media Viewer](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer/).
